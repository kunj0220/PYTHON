
#How memory is managed in Python?

"""
Pythonâ€™s memory management involves automatic processes, such as reference counting,
garbage collection, and memory pooling, which work together to efficiently manage,
memory usage without requiring the programmer to manually allocate or free memory. 
This system helps ensure that memory is used efficiently and reduces, 
the chances of memory leaks.
